# poverty_data_NYS_schools

**By:** Kate Morano
**Date:** December 8, 2025

**Data Source**
This data is publically available; it was accessed through the U.S. Census Bureau data pipeline using an API.

**Methodology**
I used python to create four API calls, each of which focused on a specific age/grade level category as specified by the U.S. Census Bureau in their data dictionary. This yielded poverty data for every school district in New York State.
